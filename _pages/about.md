I hold a PhD in Management (Economics and Public Policy) from the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, India. My research focuses on inclusive finance and its impact on development outcomes, with a particular focus on household financial resilience and financial behaviour in the face of different types of shocks. I examine how households make financial decisions, manage risk, and cope with vulnerability, and how these processes shape broader outcomes related to poverty and inequality. Within this broad area, my research covers themes such as financial inclusion, financial literacy, financial well-being, gender, and poverty. I am also interested in applied econometrics and in exploring causal inference approaches.

Currently, I am an Assistant Professor at the Birla Institute of Management Technology (BIMTECH), Greater Noida.

## PhD Thesis
  
- Title: Multidimensional Financial Resilience: Conceptualization, Measurement and Impact of Shocks
- Brief: My thesis conceptualizes financial resilience as a multidimensional, ex-ante capability. Using three studies with household-level survey
data, first, I develop a composite measure of financial resilience to capture households' ability to absorb shocks, adapt, and recover using
resources, namely: financial inclusion, financial literacy, digital literacy, participatory decision-making, and social capital. Second, I examine
how resilience evolves with exposure to shocks, whether repeated shocks build adaptive capacity or begin to erode resilience beyond a
threshold, and third, whether idiosyncratic and covariate shocks have distinct eﬀects. My findings underscore the need for policy to move
beyond one-size-fits-all support toward shock-responsive, targeted interventions that strengthen key capabilities early and tailor assistance
to the type and intensity of shocks households face
